# Fali DreamHome Reality

A beautiful, modern real estate showcase website for presenting dream homes, properties, and living spaces.

## Description

This is my **Level 200 First Semester Project Work** for the Multimedia class.  
The website is designed to help users explore luxurious and comfortable dream homes — from modern apartments to family residences — with elegant visuals, property details, and an inviting user experience.

Main goal:  
Create an attractive, responsive single-page or multi-page website that demonstrates multimedia principles (images, layout design, typography, color theory, responsiveness) while promoting the idea of "turning dream homes into reality".

## Features

- Eye-catching hero section with welcome message and call-to-action
- Gallery / showcase of featured properties with images
- Property details sections (description, location, features, price range)
- Responsive design — looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Contact / inquiry form (or placeholder for future backend)
- Smooth scrolling and modern animations (using CSS)
- Clean and professional typography and color scheme

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox / Grid), JavaScript (vanilla or light interactivity)
- **Styling enhancements**: Possibly Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS (if used) or pure custom CSS
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, GitHub
- **Multimedia elements**: Optimized images, icons (Font Awesome or similar), responsive media queries

## Installation / How to Run Locally

This is a static website (no backend required yet), so it's very easy to view.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faliyatsnexuss/my-project-work--gctu.git
